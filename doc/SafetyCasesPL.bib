As a consequence, there is an increased risk in termsof software or hardware failures that could lead to unacceptable hazards.Thus safety, more precisely functional safety, is a crucial property that mustbe ensured to avoid or mitigate these potential unacceptable hazards. Inthe automotive domain, recently (November 2011), the ISO-26262 safetystandard has been introduced to provide appropriate requirements and processes.More specically, the standard denes the system development processthat must be carried out to achieve a system that can be consideredacceptably safe. To be released on the market, systems must be certied,proofs that the systems are acceptably safe must be provided in terms of astructured argument, known as safety case, which inter-relates evidence andclaims. Certication authorities are in charge of evaluating the validity ofsuch safety cases. In the automotive domain, certication and compliancewith the standard ISO-26262 is becoming mandatory. By now, trucks donot have to be compliant with the standard. However, it is likely that by2016 they will have to. Scania is one of the leading companies in trucksdevelopment. To be ready by 2016, Scania is interested in investigatingISO-26262 as well as safety case provision. Thus this thesis focuses on theprovision of a safety case in the context of ISO-26262 for Fuel Level Estimationand Display System (FLEDS), which is one of the safety-criticalsystems in Scania.1}, author={Dardar, Raghad}, year={2014}}

 @phdthesis{Gallucci_2013, title={Building a safety case for a small sized product line of Fuel Level Display Systems}, url={http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:mdh:diva-22373}, abstractNote={ISO 26262 is an international standard valid for the automotive domain. It regulates all the activities to perform for developing safety critical systems in such domain. To be compliant with ISO 26262, all the required activities have to be performed and all the required work products have to be provided. Furthermore, in addition to develop a system in a safe way, following the safety standard guidelines, the achieved safety has also to be demonstrated. This is done through a safety case, a structured argument showing that a system is acceptably safe.ISO 26262 focuses on single systems and does not contain guidelines for product lines. Product line engineering is a valid approach to systematize reuse, aimed at reducing the effort needed to develop similar systems. But, it loses its strength when dealing with safety critical systems, since it is not aligned with safety standards. Hence, when developing a safety critical product line in the automotive domain, the work products required by ISO 26262 have to be provided every time from scratch, including the safety case, for each single system of the product line.This thesis work focuses on providing an approach for building and modeling a safety case for safety critical product lines in the automotive domain. Furthermore, the considered product line engineering approach is aligned with ISO 26262, through the inclusion of safety activities in the product line development process. Giving in this way, the concrete possibility to overtake to the current limitations, reducing the effort needed to develop and certificate each single system of a safety critical product line. To illustrate the validity of the proposed approach a safety critical product line developed by Scania is used as case study.}, author={Gallucci, Antonio}, year={2013}}
